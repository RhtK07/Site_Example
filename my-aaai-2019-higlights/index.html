They provide the <em>illusion</em> of having a dialogue but in fact do not have a clue what we are saying or meaning. What we should rather do is recognize intents via semantic parsing. We should then reason about the speech acts, infer a user's <em>plan</em>, and help them to succeed.</p><p>During the panel discussion, Imed Zitouni highlighted that the limitations of current dialogue models affect user behaviour. <strong>75-80% of the time, users only employ 4 skills</strong>: "play music", "set a timer", "set a reminder", and "show me the weather". Phil Cohen argued that we should not have to learn how to talk, how to make an offer, etc. all over again for each domain; simply parameterize by domain. James Allen’s current system. Speech acts should not depend on domain, e.g. make a request, make a reply. Percy Liang, can’t build it overnight. Can build something trivial overnight. Need tools with good backends.

Reproducing an on-policy, distributed RL system such as AlphaZero is particularly challenging as it does not have a fixed dataset and optimization is dependent on the distributed environment. Training smaller versions and scaling up is key. For reproducibility, the random seed, the git commit number, and the logs should be stored.</p><p>Joel Grus: If not notebooks, then what? https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ivK8AKgz8Hx-ZYzPC9gJyQK6tzuhR3UuhCEajFGJDlA/edit#slide=id.p</p><p>During the panel discussion, Odd Eric Gunderson argued that reproducibility should be defined as the <em>ability of an independent research team to produce the same results using the same AI method based on the documentation by the original authors</em>. Degrees of reproducibility can be measured based on the availability of different types of documentation, such as the method description, data, and code.</p><p>Pascal van Hentenryck argued that reproducibility could be made part of the review process, such as in the Mathematical Programming Computation journal where each submission requires an executable file, which does not need to be public, however. He also pointed out that empirically papers with supplementary materials are more likely to be accepted.</p><h1 id="question-answering">Question answering</h1><p>Complex question answering workshop.

Our learning systems should use rich relational representations, gather their own data, and evaluate progress.</p><p>CHECK FOR SLIDES, TEXTUAL QA SPECTRUM</p><p>AI's Ashish Sabharwal discussed the <a href="https://github.com/allenai/OpenBookQA">OpenBookQA dataset</a> presented at EMNLP 2018 during his talk. The open book setting is situated between reading comprehension and open-ended QA on the textual QA spectrum (see below). TODO ADD PIC OF TEXTUAL QA SPECTRUM</p><p>It is designed to probe a deeper understanding models rather than memorization skills and requires application of core principles to new situations. </p><p>He also argued that while entailment is recognized as a core NLP task with many applications, it is still lacking a convincing application to an end-task. This is mainly due to multi-sentence entailment being a lot harder, as irrelevant sentences often have significant textual overlap. He discussed a new model, MulTeE that separates relevance detection from information aggregation.</p><p>He also discussed the design of leaderboards, which have to make tradeoffs along multiple competing axes that have advantages and disadvantages for the host, the submitters, and the community. A particular deficit of current leaderboards is that they make it difficult to share and build upon successful techniques.</p><p>The first part of the final panel discussion focused on important outstanding technical challenges for question answering. Michael Witbrock emphasized <strong>techniques to create datasets that cannot easily be exploited by neural networks</strong>, such as the adversarial filtering of SWAG TODO ADD LINK. Ken argued that models should come up with answers and explanations rather than performing multiple choice question answering. Ashish mentioned the automatic validation of such explanations. </p><p>Eduard Hovy suggested that one way towards a system that can perform more complex QA could consist of the following steps:</p><ol><li>Build a completely symbolic numerical reasoner that leverages relations from an existing KB. For instance, using locations in GeoDB, it should be able to answer questions about whether two countries border each other, whether a country contains a city, etc.</li><li>Look at the subset of questions in existing natural language datasets that require geographical and numerical reasoning possible with the reasoner. </li><li>Annotate questions with semantic parses and train semantic parsing models to convert questions to logical forms, which can be answered with reasoner.</li><li>Augment reasoner with another reasoning component and repeat steps 2-3.</li></ol><p>The panel members note that such reasoners exist, but lack a common API.</p><h1 id="ai-for-social-good">AI for social good</h1><p>CHECK FOR SLIDES, REFERENCES</p><p>Milind Tambe</p><p>AI and multiagent systems for social good</p><p>Invited talk memorial lecture; AI for social good; looks back on 10 years of research<br>Game theory for security resource optimization, optimizing patrols at airports (LAX), air marshal assignments, coast guard patrols<br>Game theoretic patrols outperform human scheduled ones<br>Conversation / wildlife protection; game theory + machine learning poacher behaviour<br>HIV prevention<br>Tuberculosis prevention in India; predict whether and when patients drop off treatment plans for tuberculosis</p><h1 id="debate">Debate</h1><p>Oren Etzioni (AI2), Michael Littman (Brown), Jennifer Neville (Purdue), Peter Stone (UT Austin)<br>Proposition: “The AI community today should continue to focus mostly on ML methods.”</p><p>Jennifer Neville FOR: Field of AI created at summer conference on AI in US. 1966, Seymour told students to solve CV as a summer project. Thought it would be tractable and easy to encode, unlike other AI problems. People overpromised. Led to AI winter in 70s. Improvements in MT led to large improvements. 1995 first backgammon playing program. Recommender systems later. 2012, ImageNet success. 2016, AlphaGo. All breakthroughs in history of AI were due to ML.</p><p>Oren AGAINST: Views don’t express views from AI2, Populist movement in US, populist movement in UK, populist movement in ML. AI Winter, look outside, bad weather in Hawaii. CNN, ABC, HBO. Let’s look at key figures in movement: Trump movement, Roger Stone. FBI agents volunteered to arrest him. ML has Peter Stone. Coincidence. I don’t think so. Nothing short of Brexit. They are trying to build a wall between AI and ML. Define ML. Are we the adversaries? </p><p>Peter Stone: Huge questions remaining. Keep rest of AI alive in small dedicated communities.</p><p>Michael Littman: Nothing against ML. After all, it’s my initials. 60% of ML papers. What happened to you guys? Your thesis were so good. Jen’s work was on relational learning? </p><p>I had a phone call on guys. Peter Norvig is almost always wearing a Hawaiin shirt. </p><p>What do you call a green cow in a field? Invisible. ML system was trained on tons of puns. What do you call a short sense of humour? A charming saucer. Just smacks of what you get from DL systems. Depth missing. Nothing deep in DL. What do you call a murderer that has fiber? A cerial killer? </p><p>Oren: If you think of the short term publishing your papers, ML is great. It’s a paper publishing methodology. </p><p>Are we really going to answer all questions with multiplying and gradient descent? <br>Peter: I don’t think we’re disagreeing on the larger issues - Oren: Oh, we are disagreeing. <br>Jen: Go back to John McCarthy’s statement at summer conference. Every aspect of learning can be described so precisely that we can simulate. Learning is at the core of ML. <br>Oren: Are you arguing for ML based on statement that John McCarthy was right?</p><p>Closing statements</p><p>Michael: Experience understanding fundamental questions is quite different. Scientists leap over complicated computations. Think about how we can integrate ML with symbolic reasoning. Think about how symbolic reasoning needs to change to suit better our tools.<br>Peter: AI community should focus mostly on ML methods. In current state of knowledge, it is our weakest link. Know much more about other aspects of AI. Make rapid progress in ML. Put pieces together to face problems.</p><p>Oren: My adversaries in no way addressed comments about Brexit. Moderator accused our side of lacking in substance. In midst of paradigm shifts. Cognitive architectures. Do need to solve problems with ML. But can’t just do all ML. <br>Jen: All practical people to solve practical problems in AI.Need better ML methods for political forecasting and persuasion to avoid these events.</p><p>Overall, that was a really fun debate. While I mostly tweeted about the comments that elicited laughs, there were some important observations and ultimately a consensus that ML alone is not enough and we need to integrate other methods such as symbolic reasoning with ML.</p><p>Peter: If you want to have an impact, don’t follow the bandwagon. Keep alive these other areas. Focus on other areas.</p><h1 id="adversarial-learning">Adversarial learning</h1><p>During his invited talk, Ian Goodfellow discussed a multiplicity of areas to which adversarial learning has been applied. Among many advances, Ian mentioned that he was impressed by the performance and flexibility of attention masks for GANs, that they are not just restricted to circular masks. CITE self-attention GANs (Zhang et al., 2018) is useful; use layers from Wang et al. (2018); non-local neural networks (or something along those lines); self-attention GANs</p><p>He discussed adversarial examples, which are a consequence of moving away from i.i.d. data; attackers can violate assumptions; show unusual data from a different distribution (gaffiti on stop sign); find different ways to present data</p><p>Adversarial training is most useful when there is a limited amount of training data; then it can outperform training on just clean data</p><p>For many applications such as autonomous vehicles, air traffic control, surgery robots, etc. models must be extremely reliable.</p><p>Katz et al. (2017), verification system, applied to air traffic control</p><p>He also argued—contrary to popular opinion—that more robust models are preferable to linear models in terms of accountability as they are more interpretable. The latent space of a linear model is totally unintuitive and wrong, while a more robust model is more inspectable (at least for a generative computer vision model).</p><p>Semi-supervised learning with GANs can allow models to be more sample-efficient. What is interesting about such applications is that they focus on the discriminator (which is normally discarded) rather than the generator; Odena (2016); Salimans et al. (2016) Discriminator is n+1-classifier virtual adversarial training</p><p>Domain adaptation, Domain adversarial networks; professor forcing (Lamb et al., 2016); domain-adversarial learning in RNN hidden state GANs for simulated training data; Shrivastava et al. (2016) Sim-to-real via sim-to-sim (James et al., 2018)</p><p>Q: GANs for NLP? Have to back-propagate through it. RL. Action space for sentences is gigantic.
